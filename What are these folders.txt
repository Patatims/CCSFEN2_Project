This folder contains the necessary components for the Oriental "DUA" Restaurant Cashier System.

Folder Structure:

1. Database Backup: This folder contains backups of the database used by the application. It can be used to reset the database to a previous state if needed.

2. Project SE: This folder contains the source code of the application. Developers can modify and enhance the application by editing the files within this folder.

3. ProjectApp: This folder contains the executable version of the application generated using PyInstaller. Users can run the application directly from this folder without needing to install Python or any dependencies.

How to Use:

- If you need to reset the database to a previous state, navigate to the Database Backup folder and restore the desired backup file using your preferred database management tool.

- To view or modify the source code of the application, navigate to the Project SE folder and open the files using a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio Code or PyCharm.

- To run the executable version of the application, navigate to the ProjectApp folder and double-click on the executable file. The application will launch, allowing users to access its features without requiring Python or additional dependencies.
